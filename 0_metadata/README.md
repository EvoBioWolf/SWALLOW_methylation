## Metadata

Here I keep the main metadata file: hirundo_WGS_sampling_metadata_10.10.22_sm.xslx

Additionally, I have the plots of the sampling distribution. I use R packages that can work with shapefiles, so I downloaded shapefiles from the internet of the swallow distribution...which comes from Birdlife, and then simple country outlines and other climate information.

I thien plot these shapefiles along with my samples using: 1_Fig_1_Conceptual_Sample_Overview.Rmd
