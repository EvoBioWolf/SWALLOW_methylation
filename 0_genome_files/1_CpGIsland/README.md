## CPG island identification

I wanted to identify CpG islands in the H.r. rustica genome.

To do this, I used two different methods and used the overlapping CpG islands identified by both methods.

First run makeCGI in R

Then run ToJoCGI and then use the merge script to merge overlapping CpG islands.
