## GC Content

I wanted to identify the amount of GC content along the chromosomes as this could impact the number of CpG sites identified in different regions.

I identified GC content using 0_calculate_GC_content.sh

And I plotted this visually, using 1_GCcontent_manhattan.Rmd both along the genome and the relative amounts per chromsome type: macro, intermiediate, micro.
